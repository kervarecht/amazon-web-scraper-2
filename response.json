/*
""" since amazon generates a separate page for every 20 bestselling deals, I have written a function to extend the base links
the batch for all 5 amazon pages is generated from a single link (target) plus the addons link, then pushed to the variable amazon.
amazon is then used as the variable for the amazon_deals function.
If you just want to see the scraper functions they begin on line 513.
Below are the source links to kindle pages on amazon, by subject, to maintain speed.  I ran a separate beautifulSoup script to work these out
For most source links I have not gone very deep as amazon soon runs out of tracked bestseller titles. """
